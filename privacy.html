    <h1>Privacy</h1>
    <p>Published on 20th October 2021</p>

    <p>Personally, I have taken a number of steps to try and maintain my online privacy where possible. 
        So I think I would be remiss if I didn’t try and do the same for those who decide they want 
        to come and read or consume the content that I put out on this site.
        <br><br>
        I want to do what I can to maintain the privacy of visitors to this site wherever possible. 
        So what do I do to help ensure your privacy is maintained?
    </p>

    <h1>HTTPS Always</h1>
    <p>This site uses HTTPS everywhere. If you try and access this site using HTTP, you will be redirected to HTTPS.
    <br><br>
    <i>So what?</i> you might say. HTTPS is important, as it ensures your connection to my server is always 
    encrypted (among other things). So any spying eyes won’t be able to see what you’re doing whilst on here.</p>

    <h1>Analytics</h1>
    <p>There are simply no analytics on this site. 
    </p>

    <h1>Cookies</h1>
    <p>No tracking cookies will be dropped on to your machine from this website, which means there is <i>no 
        unique ID that I can use to identify and track you</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can also use an online tool like <a href="https://www.cookiemetrix.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">Cookie Metrix</a> to see what cookies are stored on your machine when you visit my site.
        <br><br>
        <i>Spoiler – there are no cookies! </i>xD
    </p>

    <h1>Javascript</h1>
    <p>Personally, I don’t see the harm in using JS but I like it without anyway, however potentially
        Javascript can be used to monitor your online behavior on the sites you visit.
    </p>
    <p>Wanna see what Javascript is capable of check out <a href="https://clickclickclick.click" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none">clickclickclick.click</a> - A browser-based online profiling game. <i>(Try on PC)</i></p>

    <h1>Ads</h1>
    <p>That terrible idea is out of the question!</p>

    <p><strong>Summary: </strong>This site doesn't employ any ads, trackers, identifiers, cookies, analytics or even Javascript
